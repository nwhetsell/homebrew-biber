# homebrew-biber

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for installing previous versions of [biber](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/). It has been archived because [biber in Homebrew core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/b/biber.rb) is tested against TeX Live with https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/173159.

To install biber 2.19, run:

```sh
brew install nwhetsell/biber/biber@2.19
```
